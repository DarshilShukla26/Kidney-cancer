# Deep Learning Research on Kidney Cancer

This repository contains research and experimentation with deep learning models for kidney cancer classification. Explored various models including MobileNet, Vision Transformer (ViT), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Van model. Each model is implemented in a separate Jupyter notebook for clarity and ease of understanding.

## Models

### 1. MobileNet
- **File**: `mobilenet.ipynb`
- Description: This notebook implements the MobileNet architecture for kidney cancer classification. MobileNet is known for its efficiency and effectiveness in computer vision tasks, particularly in scenarios with limited computational resources.

### 2. Vision Transformer (ViT)
- **File**: `vit.ipynb`
- Description: This notebook explores the Vision Transformer model for kidney cancer classification. ViT has gained popularity for its attention-based approach to processing images, showing promising results in various vision tasks.

### 3. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- **File**: `Kidney_Detection_SVM.ipynb`
- Description: This notebook investigates the use of Support Vector Machine (SVM) for kidney cancer classification. SVM is a classical machine learning algorithm known for its effectiveness in binary classification tasks.

### 4. Van Model
- **File**: `Van.ipynb`
- Description: This notebook presents the Van model, a custom deep learning architecture tailored for kidney cancer classification. The Van model incorporates specific features and design choices optimized for the dataset and the task at hand.
